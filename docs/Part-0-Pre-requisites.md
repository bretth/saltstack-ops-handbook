Tools and services used in this handbook can be substituted for your own personal choice. 

- A basic understanding of Python is essential
-  [pew](https://github.com/berdario/pew) is used to manage the python virtual environment
- brew is used to manage macOS packages
- gpg (or gpg suite for macOS) is used to encrypt secrets
- Vultr* hosted _Ubuntu 16.04x64_ _LTS _ instances

*There is only basic support for Vultr in SaltStack but they are a cheap, high-performance, easy to use option for small projects that have a wide variety of regional locations (including my hometown of Sydney). You could substitute with any other provider including Vagrant. While it lasts you can get credit if you use this [link](http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6940027-3B) .
